# print("it worked!")

# Here are some practice problems you should be able to puzzle out after Session 1


## Problem  : Create an empty list called "list_1". Append 5 different integers to it
list_1=[]
list_1.append(1)
list_1.append(2)
list_1.append(3)
list_1.append(4)
print(list_1)


## Problem  : Create another empty list called "list_2". Then, write a loop that squares each number in list_1 and appends it to list_2


## Problem  : Write an if/else statement to print if a number is odd or even.


## Problem  : Use your if/else statement with a for loop to print "odd" or "even" for every item in list_2


## Problem  :  Create a dictionary containing key value pairs for your name, email address, and any other pertinent information


## Problem  : Print every number between 0 and 100


## Problem  : Write a function that prints every number up to a given input


## Problem  : Modify your function so that you can choose a starting number, an ending number, and how many numbers to count by (count by 2s, by 3s, etc)


## Problem  : Fizzbuzz - Loop through every number between 1 and 100. If the number is evenly divisible by 3, print "FIZZ". If the number is evenly divisible by 5, print "BUZZ". If the number is evenly divisible by 3 and 5, print "FIZZBUZZ". Otherwise, just print the number


## Problem  : Build a small rock-paper-scissors program that asks the user for input "rock", "paper", or "scissors". Randomly generate a choice for the computer, and print the choices and the winner.
